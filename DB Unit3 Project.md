## Criteria A: Planning 

### Identified Problem 
My client, Cathy, needs a new system for recording down her CAS activity for IB. She is currently using Managebac, however the features are very user unfriendly since it loads slowly, and the features needed are hard to find and difficult to navigate. The client, therefore, wants a system which is made specifically for recording CAS activity, which can also record the CAS activity in a calendar, . An additional issue my client has with Managebac is that it lacks a personalised interface, and so I will customise the new program to include a monkey theme because my client explicitly mentioned images of monkeys must be present to make it feel personal.
